Avoid "condescending" language like:

* "think about how you would sort an array"
* "remember" the array is an array of arrays (just omitt "remember" and say it!)


Avoid vague words like "some" in "write some code." just "write code."

"if we want to access the top-left corner"
becomes "to access the top-left corner"

don't use the word "obvious"
