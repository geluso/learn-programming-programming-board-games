* Introduction
  * This book is written for non-pgrammers, begginer, intermediate and advanced
    programmers.
  * For non-programmers it offers a look at the structure of board games and
    how their structure and mechanisms can be translated into programs.
  * For beginner programmers it offers an introduction to programming paired
    with practical projects.
  * For intermediate programmers it offers an introduction to common data
    structures and algorithms pared with practical projects.
  * For advanced programmers it offers a survey of how to approach different
    complex programming challenges and outlines common patterns, problems and
    techniques.
